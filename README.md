# Supply-Chain-Dashboard
A supply chain management dashboard is a visual representation of relevant information related to the performance of a supply chain. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the supply chain's health, allowing managers to quickly identify any areas of concern and make data-driven decisions. 

The dashboard typically includes various graphs, charts, and tables that display metrics such as inventory levels, lead times, delivery performance, and supplier performance. The data is often presented in real time, allowing managers to monitor the supply chain's performance as it happens.

The dashboard may also include alerts, notifications, and other features that draw attention to potential issues or opportunities. For example, if inventory levels drop below a certain threshold, the dashboard may automatically send an alert to the appropriate manager, allowing them to act before stockouts occur.

Overall, the dashboard of a supply chain management visualization serves as a powerful tool for monitoring and optimizing supply chain performance, enabling managers to make more informed decisions and drive improvements in efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.
